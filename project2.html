    <h1>MY school's name is called <i>Summerhill</i></h1><br>
    My school is located in South Africa,Pertoria
    There is only <sup>200</sup>students in the whole colleage


    <br>Summerhill prioritized studies. That is the reason why they offer <i>two educational boards</i>
    THE first;IEB,is a local study board used only in SOUTH Africa

    
    <br>The second:<i>CAMBRIGE</i>is the british educational board and you can go around the world and study the same thing 
    it was one of the best school in the area and is one of the only school near me that use Cambridge
